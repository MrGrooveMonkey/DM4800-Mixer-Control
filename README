DM4800-Mixer-Control
Python-based control interface for the Tascam DM-4800 digital mixer

Overview
DM4800-Mixer-Control is a Python application that enables external control of the Tascam DM-4800 mixer’s faders, pan pots, and mute switches.
Ir runs on MacOS and Windows. Might run on Unix but haven't tested it there.
It provides a GUI for hands-on control via mouse/keyboard (All OS's) or touchscreen (Windows only)

Features
GUI control via PyQt5 interface.
Mixer fader automation — adjust channel levels programmatically or interactively.
Pan control — modify stereo positioning remotely.
Mute toggling — programmatically mute or unmute mixer channels.
Stereo pair display improvements — this branch enhances the way paired channels are shown.
MIDI communication — leverages mido with python-rtmidi as the backend.
Editable CSVs allow custom mapping and naming for flexible integration.

Requirements
Install Python 3.x and the following dependencies:
pip install PyQt5 mido python-rtmidi

Installation & Setup
# Clone the repository
git clone -b MrGrooveMonkey-StereoPair-Display-improvements https://github.com/MrGrooveMonkey/DM4800-Mixer-Control.git
cd DM4800-Mixer-Control

# (Optional) Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install PyQt5 mido python-rtmidi

Usage
Connect the Tascam DM-4800 to your computer via MIDI (USB/MIDI ports).
Run the main script:
python DM4800v013c.py
Use the GUI to:
Adjust faders
Pan channels
Toggle mute
View stereo pairs

Module Listing
DM4800v013c.py — Main application (latest version).
DM4800claude012.py & DM4800claude012d.py — Previous iterations, useful for reference or alternate workflows.
Notes & Further Development
The application relies on the DM-4800’s MIDI implementation for all remote control functions.
Stereo pair visualization is an active area of improvement in this branch.

Controls / GUI Layout
The GUI is organized into a mixer window containing multiple channel strips:
Channel Strip (ChannelStrip)
FaderWithScale — vertical slider showing dB scale.
PanDial — circular dial with center mark (green).
MuteButton — toggle mute on/off.
ScribbleStripTextEdit — text entry for channel name.
Mono/Stereo label — shows channel format.
Wide Stereo Strip (WideStereoStrip)
Used for stereo-paired channels.
Wider fader to represent linked L/R.
MixerWindow (main window)
Scrollable list of channel strips.
Menu options for loading/saving settings.
Access to MIDI Monitor window.
Dialogs & Tools
MidiPortSelectionDialog — choose MIDI in/out ports.
MidiMonitorWindow — live view of MIDI messages.

Configuration Files
DM4800_CC_Values.csv — MIDI CC mapping values.
scribblestrip.csv — custom channel names for scribble strips.
DM4800MonoStereo.csv — mono/stereo configuration data.
dm4800_settings.json — saved settings (GUI state, ports, etc.).
DM4800_MIDI_Log.txt — log of recent MIDI messages.
